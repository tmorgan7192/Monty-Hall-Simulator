# Monty-Hall-Simulator
A simulator for the Monty Hall problem

The Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in probability based on the TV show "Let's make a deal!" 

A contestant on a game show is presented with three doors.  Behind one of the doors is a new car!  Behind the other two are goats.  The contestant is asked to pick a door.  After this the host, knowing what is behind each of the doors, opens one of the doors not picked by the contestant revealing a goat.  The contestant is then given the opportunity to switch to the remaining unopened door before opening the door to receive their prize.  Should the contestant switch doors?

Most people, when presented with this problem, reason that since there are 2 doors remaining and 1 contains a car, there is a 50/50 chance that your door has the car.  Therefore it doesn't matter if you switch.  However, this reasoning is false.  It turns out you are twice as likely to win if you switch doors.  This simulator lets you try out the game for yourself and keeps tracks of your wins and losses to empirically verify that this counterintuitive idea is true.
